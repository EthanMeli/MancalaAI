# Mancala AI
<p>
  Welcome to my Mancala AI Project! This Project was created for my Intro to Artificial Intelligence class I took during the Fall 2024 Semester. All contents of the project, including the writeup can be found in the file titled "Meli_Ethan_CSCI_3200_Project.ipynb". Note that this is a Jupyter Notebook file, and the code is written entirely in Python. Feel free to check out a brief look at the <a href="https://www.scholastic.com/content/dam/teachers/blogs/alycia-zimmerman/migrated-files/mancala_rules.pdf">rules</a> of Mancala if you have never played to get a better idea of the implementation.
